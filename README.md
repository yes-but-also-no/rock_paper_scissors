# Block, Paper, Scissors!

Block, Paper, Scissors is a novel take on the age-old dispute-settling game we grew up with, powered by The Internet Computer.

Players will play against eachother by utilizing the power of the block chain.

The Block, Paper, Scissors canister always holds the last move made (and an optional nickname, should players choose to leave one).

In order to reveal the last move, players must submit a new move. Once they submit a move, they are shown if their move resulted in a win, loss, or tie. The player's move then takes it's place in the canister, awaiting the next challenger. This cycle continues indefinitely.

Players can play anonymously, or may choose to select a short nickname if they wish to record their progress and participate in the leaderboard (Think high scores on an arcade cabinet).

The main purpose of this project has been to get my feet wet in the dfinity ecosystem, as well as to test the power of the internet computer and evaluate its current progress.

The source code to this project will be available on Github as well, to help assist any other developers who are interested in learning more.
